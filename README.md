^^^ *That's Me!* 

**I have three main hobbies**

# Music

I am currently working on an album and I play the piano and I am just starting to learn the bass. I use garageband for my music and I am hoping to finish my album by the end of the year

# Video Games

I've been dating my girlfriend for almost 7 months and in the time I have played videogames a lot less, but everytime I hop on to play now they are **EXHILIRATING!!** I think its because I don't play them at all now. I love the Far Cry series, Sea of Thieves and I'm playing Dying Light 2 at the moment!
